# PomodoroTimer
A pomodoro timer/study habits app that incorporates all the features that I can't find in paid ones. 

# Changelog
8/5/25 - made the repo, implemented phase shifts and semi-configurable phase times. Fixed several race conditions. 

# Motivation 
I paid 10 dollars for a pomodoro app on my mac that blocked apps and allowed me to change durations of breaks (i had an itunes giftcard so it wasn't a scam). I think
it's entirely possible to create a pomodoro app that is fast, compact, and **actually has features we'd want to use**. 

Shoutout to my friends (yong and tida) for giving me feature ideas!
